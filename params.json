{"name":"Predicting the Oligomerization of Fluorescent Proteins","tagline":"Fluorescent Protein","body":"### Predicting the Oligomerization of Fluorescent Protein\r\n\r\nA large number of coral fluorescent proteins (FP) are found in anthozoans because of its  homologous tertiary structure to the Aequorea victoria jellyfish. These FPs represent an important class of bioluminescent protein owing to its immense utility for biomedical imaging in the life science. Such popularity lies in the diversity of its spectral colors and the fact that it does not require any co-factor owing to the autocatalytic post-translational modification of the chromophore from three or four amino acid precursors. In here, we perform computational analysis on predicting the oligomerization properties of FP by means of reproducible research with J48 classifier using commonly used and highly interpretable amino acid descriptors.\r\n\r\n### Green Fluorescent Protein\r\n\r\n![3-Dimensional Structure of GFP](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fmViYbhmOd0/TKjgToUFnsI/AAAAAAAAAD0/jggFP963keU/s1600/GFP_slate1.png)\r\n\r\nThe Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was discovered in 1961 by [Osamu Shimomura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Shimomura) from the Aequorea victoria jellyﬁsh residing in the Paciﬁc Northwest as a by-product of aequorin. But the research into the properties and characterisation of GFP processed slowly as it was in 1992, when [Douglas Prasher](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037811199290691H) eventually clone the gene encoding the GFP. Two years after that, [Martin Chalﬁe](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.8303295) demonstrated that it was possible to express this protein in a bacterial system and had thus opened up several avenues of opportunities. [Roger Tsien](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5280.1392) expanded the spectral repertoire of GFP by directly modifying the chromophore via substitution of Y66 to other aromatic residues (i.e. histidine, tryptophan and phenylalanine) as well as modifying environmental residues (i.e. T203Y).\r\n\r\n### Problem with Oligomerization in Fluorescent Protein\r\n\r\nDespite being the essential tagging tool for live biomedical imagings, oligomerization of FP hinder its utilization as problems, including, abnormal localizations, perturbing normal functions, interfering with signaling cascades, and preventing the normal oligomerization fusion products  within a specific organelle were reported. [Shcherbo et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth1083)  stressed that Katushka, the dimeric far-red mutants of fluorescent proteins from  sea anemone Entacmaea quadricolor, formed abnormal localization in Phoenix Eco cells. [Mizuno et al.] (http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi002263b) demonstrated that aggregation of DsRed disturbs normal function of calmodulin in the cytosol . [Zacharias](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/stke.2002.131.pe23) stressed that oligomerization of FP creates problems as it interfere with signaling cascades of target protein when using them as a tagging probes for Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). [Lauf et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(01)02462-0) stressed that tetrameric DsRed tagged with connexins creates problems because DsRed cross-linked between different connexin thereby causing a negative effect on connexin function.\r\n\r\n### Out Master Plan\r\n\r\n**However**, until now, experimental studies (random/rational mutagenesis and screening of novel FP) were utilised to address oligomerization problems, which is costly, time consuming and labor intensive. This study present the first computational study on oligomerization of FP based on primary amino acid sequences with manually curated data set, comprising of 376 FP.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
