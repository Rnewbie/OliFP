{"name":"Oligomerization of Fluorescent Protein","tagline":"Fluorescent Protein","body":"### Predicting the Oligomerization of Fluorescent Protein\r\nA large number of coral fluorescent proteins (FP) are found in anthozoans because of its  homologous tertiary structure to the Aequorea victoria jellyfish. These FPs represent an important class of bioluminescent protein owing to its immense utility for biomedical imaging in the life science. Such popularity lies in the diversity of its spectral colors and the fact that it does not require any co-factor owing to the autocatalytic post-translational modification of the chromophore from three or four amino acid precursors. In here, we perform computational analysis on predicting the oligomerization properties of FP by means of reproducible research with J48 classifier using commonly used and highly interpretable amino acid descriptors.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
